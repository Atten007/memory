# memory
A simple memory game that's written in HTML, CSS and JS.

Everyone who wants can contribute to this game (e.g. make a fork of this GitHub repository or download these project files, modify them and upload them back to your own GitHub repository)! It's a completely free game that I started working on just for fun in a german programming workshop. The game will receive updates until it's finished.
